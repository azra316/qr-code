# **QR Code Component - Frontend Mentor Challenge**

This is my first project on **Frontend Mentor**, where I built a **QR Code Component** using **HTML** and **CSS**. The project helped me practice responsive design techniques and develop a better understanding of layout structures.

## **Responsive Design**
This project is responsive for:
- Mobile devices (375px width and above)
- Tablets
- Desktop screens

## **Challenges Faced**
1. Initially, I struggled to vertically center the component. I learned how to use `100vh` with **Flexbox** for proper alignment.
2. Ensuring the design matched the given mockups was tricky but improved my attention to detail.
